Glossa
======
Android app

Glossa gives quick translations of words or phrases in other apps. In another app, highlight a word or phrase (usually by long-pressing), use the app's share feature, and select "Ad hoc glossa" from the share-to menu. Glossa will pop up a translation of that word or phrase.
